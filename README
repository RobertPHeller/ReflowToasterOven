This project is based on the Instructables "Hack a Toaster Oven for Reflow
Soldering" by frank26080115 at

Notable differences:

1) It uses an ArduinoUno as the processing element and all of the electronics 
(except the display, pushbuttons, buzzer, and relay) are mounted on an 
Adafruit Proto Shield -- all of the components are through-hole components.

2) Everything is mounted in a pair of plastic boxes and instead of "hacking" 
an extension code, an AC power and a pair of AC Receptacles are used.

3) An Adafruit 1.8" *Color* TFT LCD SPI display is used, using Adafruit's 
graphics library.

4) The software is a "standard" Arduino project.

I have not built or tested it yet.
